We are Python class in Kazan, Russia and we do things together. This project is one of those..

Basically, the Ruffier Squat Test is a simple cardiovascular endurance test which involves measuring heart rate before and after performing 30 squats in 45 seconds. The test was originally developed in 1950s by James-Edward Ruffier and modified by J. Dickson, who developed the Ruffier-Dickson index (RDI). From the results of this squat test you can calculate the Ruffier-Dickson Index, commonly used in France to classify Cardio-respiratory fitness.
